# Photography Portfolio Template

Example of a portfolio for a photographer

## Description

I created this website during my self-taught apprenticeship.
The idea was to train myself to use the Bootstrap framework and the Gulp.js task runner on a simple design that could be reused.

Of course the website is completely fictitious as is the character of Sylvain Duchenes.
